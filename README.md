# KaseiCoin - Crowdsale
KaseiCoin is a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. This contract launches a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

## Technologies

Pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

---

## Installation Guide
run/deploy program using Solidity
Ganache/Metamask

---

## Usage
The crowdsale contract manages the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. The contract mints the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.



* Step 1: Create the KaseiCoin token contract.

* Step 2: Create the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract.

* Step 3: Create the KaseiCoin deployer contract.

* Step 4: Perform a real-world, pre-production test of your crowdsale. In order to do so, you will deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain by using 
  Remix,MetaMask, and Ganache.

* Step 5: Record a short video or take several screenshots that show the deployed contract in action.
